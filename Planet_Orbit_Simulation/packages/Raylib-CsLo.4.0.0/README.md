# About
Managed C# bindings to `Raylib`, a friendly 2d/3d game framework similar to XNA / MonoGame.
- Win/Linux/OsX supported.
- Includes bindings for raylib extras: `RayGui`, `Easings`, `Physac`, `RlGl`, `RayMath`.
- Minimal bindings + convenience wrappers to make it easier to use.
- Tested and verified **ALL** 100+ Raylib examples.  These [ported examples are available to you in the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/Raylib-CsLo.Examples)
-    Requires `unsafe` for 3d workflows.
-    Supports `net5+`, `Mono 6.4+`, `NetCore3+` (via `netStandard 2.1`)
-    Tested on `Win10`.  User Reports `Arch` Linux works.  Please test on other platforms and [raise an issue](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/issues) if any problems occur.
- A focus on performance.  No runtime allocations if at all possible.
- No intellisense docs. [read the raylib cheatsheet for docs](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) or [view the examples](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/Raylib-CsLo.Examples)
- Full source code included in [The GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo), including native sources, allowing you to compile for any platform you wish.

## What is **Raylib**?
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) is a friendly-to-use game framework that includes basic scenarios to meet your needs:   audio, 2d, 3d, fonts, animation, 2d physics.  Somewhat similar to `Xna` or `MonoGame` but friendlier.  **However, `Raylib` is a C/CPP framework**.  `Raylib-CsLo` is a C# Wrapper over the top, which lets you gain raylib's powers to quickly prototype your game ideas.

## Super easy to use for 2d!
If you stick with 2d, you don't need to use any `unsafe` (pointer) code, which lets 2d users feel at home and use `Raylib-CsLo` as an awesome 2d game framework.   

## High performance for 3d!  (but `unsafe` to use)
If you use 3d, you need to understand a bit of how pointers work. Raylib uses these to link things like `Model`, `Mesh`, and `Material`.  Writing wrappers over these is possible but it would basically be creating a an entirely new framework.  I suggest leaving this as-is, as it avoids object allocation (GC Pressure).

Additionally, 3d users: **Be sure you check the Usage Tips section below**, especially on how you need to use `Matrix4x4.Transpose()` when sending matricies to Raylib.

# How to use/install
## via Nuget
1. add the latest version of [The Raylib-CsLo Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Raylib-CsLo) to your project
2. Create an example project using it, the following code is coppied from [The StandAlone Example's Program.cs](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/StandaloneExample/program.cs)
```cs
using Raylib_CsLo;

namespace StandaloneExample
{
	public static class Program
	{
		public static async Task Main(string[] args)
		{
			Raylib.InitWindow(1280, 720, "Hello, Raylib-CsLo");
			Raylib.SetTargetFPS(60);
			// Main game loop
			while (!Raylib.WindowShouldClose()) // Detect window close button or ESC key
			{
				Raylib.BeginDrawing();
				Raylib.ClearBackground(Raylib.SKYBLUE);
				Raylib.DrawFPS(10, 10);
				Raylib.DrawText("Raylib is easy!!!", 640 , 360, 50, Raylib.RED);
				Raylib.EndDrawing();
			}
			Raylib.CloseWindow();
		}
	}
}
```
## via sources
1. clone/download the [github repository](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo)
2. open `./Raylib-CsLo-DEV.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
3. build and run.
   - the `Raylib-CsLo.Examples` project will run by default, and will run through all (aprox 100+) examples.
4. For a stand-alone example that uses the Nuget Package, see the [`./StandaloneExample` folder](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/StandaloneExample)

# Linux / OsX / other platform support

The following platforms are shipped in the nuget package:
- `win-x64` : confirmed working on `Win10, x64`.  This is the platform used for dev/testing of `raylib-cslo`.
- `linux-x64`: confirmed working on `Arch` Linux.  Binaries built under `Ubuntu 20.04` so that shold also work.
- `osx-x64`:  not confirmed yet.  Please let me know if you try.

You can build the native binaries for whatever platform you need.  Please see the readme under https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/Raylib-CsLo/runtimes for more info.

# Extras (1st person, 3rd person cameras)
If you need a custom camera, check out the `Raylib-Extras-CsLo` project, which contains a custom First Person Camera and Third Person Camera.  https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-Extras-CsLo


# Usage Tips / FAQ
- **How do I do `SOME_IDEA`?**
  - All the Raylib examples (100+) have been ported successfully.  Please refer to them here: [ALL 100+ Raylib examples](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/tree/main/Raylib-CsLo.Examples).  If you need more help, ask on Discord.
- **Does `Raylib-CsLo` include the `SOME_FUNCTION_YOU_NEED()` function?**
  - Raylib-CsLo has bindings for everything in the Raylib 4.0 release, including extras like `raygui` and `physac`, but with the exception of things in the `Known Issues` section further below.
- **Why didn't you add a wrapper for function `SOME_OTHER_FUNCTION_YOU_NEED()`?** 
  - Raylib-CsLo uses a manual marshalling technique, as the built in PInvoke marshalling is not very efficienct.  Most API's have wrappers (and all involving `string` marshalling), but some involving pointers have been left as-is.  If you come across a function that you feel needs more wrapping, you can [raise an issue](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/issues) or perhaps [submit a PR](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo/pulls)
- **How do I convert a string to `sbyte*` or vice-versa?**
  - All API's that take `sbyte*` have `string` wrappers, so be sure to look at the overload you can call.
- **Do I have to really cast my Enum to `int`?**
  -  The autogen bindings are left untouched, however convenience wrappers are added.  Usually these will automagically "work" via function overloads, but where this is not possible, try adding an underscore `_` to the end of the function/property.  For example:  `Camera3D.projection_ = CameraProjection.CAMERA_ORTHOGRAPHIC;` or `Gesture gesture = Raylib.GetGestureDetected_();`.
  -  If all else fails, yes.  Cast to `(int)`.
- **I ran the examples in a profiler.   What are all these `sbyte[]` arrays being allocated?**
   -  A pool of `sbyte[]` is allocated for string marshall purposes, to avoid runtime allocations.
- **Can I, Should I use `RayMath`?**
  - `Raylib_CsLo.RayMath` contains a lot of super helpful functions for doing gamedev related maths.
  - The `RayMath` helper functions have been translated into C# code.   This makes the code pretty fast, but if the same function exists under `System.Numerics` you should use that instead, because the DotNet CLR treats things under System.Numerics special, and optimizes it better.
- **Why are my matricies corrupt?**
  - Raylib/OpenGl uses column-major matricies, while dotnet/vulkan/directx uses row-major.  When passing your final calculated matrix to raylib for rendering, call `Matrix4x4.Transpose(yourMatrix)`

# Known Issues:
- `RayGui`: be sure to call `RayGui.GuiLoadStyleDefault();` right after you `InitWindow()`.  This is needed to initialize the gui properly.  If you don't, if you close a raylib window and then open a new one (inside the same app), the gui will be broken.
- The `Text.Unicode` example doesn't render unicode properly.  Maybe the required font is missing, maybe there is a bug in the example (Utf16 to Utf8 conversion) or maybe there is a bug in Raylib.  A hunch: I think it's probably due to the fonts not including unicode characters, but I didn't investigate further.
-  Native Memory allocation functions are not ported:  use `System.Runtime.InteropServices.NativeMemory.Alloc()` instead
-  `LogCustom()` is ported but doesn't support variable length arguments.
-  `Texture2D` doesn't exist.  it is just an alias for `Texture` so use that instead.  You might want to use `using` aliases like the following
      ```cs
      //usings to make C# code more like the raylib cpp examples.   
      //to see more stuff like this, look at Raylib-CsLo.Examples/program.cs
      global using Camera = Raylib_CsLo.Camera3D;
      global using RenderTexture2D = Raylib_CsLo.RenderTexture;
      global using Texture2D = Raylib_CsLo.Texture;
      global using TextureCubemap = Raylib_CsLo.Texture;
      global using Matrix = System.Numerics.Matrix4x4;
      ```

# How to Contribute

0) assume you are using Visual Studio (or maybe rider?) and can run `dev.sln`
1) fork the repo, build and try out the example project
2) Pick something to do
  - test/improve support on linux and/or OsX
  - improve wrappers for ease of use
  - ????  check issues
